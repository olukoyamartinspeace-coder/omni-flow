# OmniFlow Protocol Whitepaper
**Version 1.0.0**

## 1. Abstract
OmniFlow represents a paradigm shift from static smart contracts to **Adaptive Autonomous Agreements (AAA)**. By leveraging on-chain AI agents, Quantum-Resistant Cryptography, and Behavioral Biometrics, OmniFlow ensures that digital identities and assets are secure against both current and future threats (Post-Quantum).

## 2. Core Architecture
### 2.1. The AI Execution Layer
OmniFlow leverages client-side AI and blockchain primitives:
-   **Biometric Risk Scoring**: Real-time analysis of facial landmarks and behavior.
-   **On-Chain Verification**: Quantum public keys are registered on the `QuantumWallet` contract.

### 2.2. Quantum-Resistant Identity
We assume ECDSA (used by Bitcoin/Ethereum) is a legacy risk. OmniFlow uses:
-   **Signatures**: CRYSTALS-Dilithium level 5 security.
-   **Verification**: Public key hashes stored on the BNB Testnet.
-   **Proof Metadata**: Transactions include quantum-safe proof strings.

## 3. The Ultimate Backup (DNA)
Digital keys are fragile. OmniFlow introduces **Synthetic Biological Cold Storage**:
1.  **Reed-Solomon Encoding**: Private keys $\to$ error-corrected binary $\to$ Base Pairs (A, C, G, T).
2.  **Synthesis**: Simulated integration with bioscience APIs for DNA fragment production.
3.  **Longevity**: Physical data storage capable of surviving for millennia.
## 4. Behavioral "Zero-Interaction" Auth
Passwords and 2FA are friction. OmniFlow builds a **Behavioral Fingerprint** based on:
-   **Keystroke Dynamics**: Flight time and Dwell time.
-   **Touch Patterns**: Swipe velocity and pressure (Mobile).
This runs passively in the background, assigning a continuous `RiskScore`.

## 5. Security Protocols
-   **Dead Man's Switch**: If a user is inactive for $N$ days, ownership rotates to a pre-defined social guardian or DAO.
-   **Anti-Tamper**: The app self-destructs sensitive keys if Root/Jailbreak is detected.

## 6. Metaverse Interoperability
Your identity is not an account; it is a portable asset.
-   **Universal Bridge**: Uses LayerZero/CCIP to transport `Proof-of-Identity` to Decentraland, Sandbox, and beyond.
