# OmniFlow: Post-Quantum Identity on opBNB Mainnet

## 🚀 The Innovation
OmniFlow solves the "Fragile Identity" problem in Web3. Current wallets rely on ECDSA signatures (vulnerable to quantum advancement) and mnemonic seeds (vulnerable to human loss). OmniFlow is a unified protocol that binds identity to the human body and the physical world through:
1.  **Post-Quantum Cryptography** (CRYSTALS-Dilithium)
2.  **Multimodal Biometrics** (AI-Powered Face/Iris)
3.  **Biological Persistence** (DNA-Based Recovery)
Implemented on the high-performance **opBNB Mainnet**.
## 🛠️ Technical Depth
-   **Smart Contracts**: `QuantumWallet.sol` implements on-chain registration and verification of quantum-safe public key hashes. It introduces the concept of "Quantum-Ready" accounts on the BNB Chain.
-   **AI Biometric Engine**: Uses **MediaPipe** and **TensorFlow.js** for real-time facial landmarking. Features passive liveness detection and local-only embedding generation.
-   **Synthetic Biology Interop**: A novel encoding scheme (Reed-Solomon + Base-4) that maps cryptographic private keys into synthetic DNA sequences for ultra-long-term cold storage.
-   **Zero-Framework Frontend**: Built entirely in Vanilla JS/HTML5/CSS3 to ensure maximum longevity and security, avoiding the "dependency rot" of modern frameworks.

## 🔐 Security Standards
-   **Rule 4 Compliance**: Raw biometric data never leaves the browser.
-   **Quantum First**: All cryptographic primitives are post-quantum safe.
-   **Deterministic Resilience**: Automated Reed-Solomon error correction for DNA recovery.

## 📈 Future Roadmap
-   **Mainnet Deployment & Audit**: Moving from Testnet registration to fully audited mainnet infrastructure.
-   **TEE Integration**: Moving AI risk-scoring agents into Trusted Execution Environments (Intel SGX).
-   **Cross-Chain Identity**: Bridging OmniFlow identities via LayerZero to other virtual worlds.
